# small-bibs

This is an index of small bibliographic databases. By small, I mean much smaller than major databases like Scopus. A database with 100,000 entries would still be "small" here. These databases are often far more specialized than large databases like Scopus, may have curated the entries, may have more specific subject categories, keywords, or annotations than a larger database, and are often developed by individuals or professional societies.

I'm using the word "database" here broadly, including everything from actual software with a SQL database down to .bib files and even .txt files listing citations with comments.

Contributions are welcome. Unfortunately these databases are often obscure or even no longer online, so I'm hoping that by creating an index I'll make these databases easier to find.
