# small-bibs

This is an index of small bibliographic databases. By small, I mean much smaller than major databases like Scopus. A database with over 100,000 entries could still be "small" here. Over a million entries is not likely "small". These databases are often far more specialized than large databases like Scopus, may have curated the entries, may have more specific subject categories, keywords, or annotations than a larger database, and are often developed by individuals or professional societies rather than for-profit corporations. In other words, these smaller bibliographic databases often are developed with more care.

I'm using the word "database" here broadly, including everything from actual software with a SQL database down to .bib files and even .html and .txt files merely listing citations.

Contributions are welcome. Unfortunately these databases are often obscure or even no longer online, so I'm hoping that by creating an index I'll make these databases easier to find. This index is heavily biased towards my own interests and things I found by randomly browsing the internet and I would like to change that.
